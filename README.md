This project is a real-time American Sign Language (ASL) recognition system that uses computer vision and deep learning to identify hand gestures and speak the corresponding letter using text-to-speech.

Features
* Real-time hand detection using MediaPipe
* Letter prediction using a trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
* Speech synthesis using pyttsx3 to vocalize the detected letter
* Live webcam feed with an easy-to-use Tkinter GUI
